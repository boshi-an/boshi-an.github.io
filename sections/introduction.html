        I am currently pursuing a master's degree at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> and
        joining the <a href="https://srl.ethz.ch" target="_blank">Soft Robotics Lab</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH</a>
        as a master's student, supervised by <a href="https://srl.ethz.ch" target="_blank">Prof. Robert Katzschmann</a>.
        At EPFL, I am supervised by <a href="https://www.mathislab.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Alexander Mathis</a> on computational neuroscience.
        I am also a visiting student at <a href="https://ucd-dare.github.io" target="_blank">DARE Lab</a>, UC Davis, supervised by <a href="https://junshanzhang.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Junshan Zhang</a>.
        I received my honours degree (summa cum laude) from <a
          href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm" target="_blank">Turing class</a>
        at the <a href="https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a>,
        <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, where
        I was mainly advised by <a href="https://zsdonghao.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Hao Dong</a> on
        robotics learning.
        I also collaborated closely with <a href="https://z0ngqing.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Zongqing Lu</a> on
        the spatial cognitive abilities of machine learning models.

            I'm interested in reinforcement learning, robotics and computational neurology.
          </p>

          <p>
            To me, the essence of robotics lies in agility and dexterity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across evolution, animals have refined motor control in a billion-year interplay
            of body and nervous system — through a vast distributed training process governed by survival and death,
            extending three orders of magnitude beyond humanity's brief venture into language, logic, and mathematics,
            the very emblems of our civilization.

            The architecture of the brain itself inscribes this history: to motion are entrusted far more neurons than ever
            to words.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take pride in having taught machines to mirror our language,
            yet in doing so we are reminded of our limits:
            for what we prize as the summit of intellect, evolution regards as a late ornament.
          </p>
          <p>
            As humble pilgrims we walk, striving to grasp nature's vast bequest in motor control,
            to emulate its mastery, and perhaps one day, to venture beyond it.
