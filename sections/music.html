        Music is also a big part of my life 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I spend most of my free time in front of the piano.
        I especially enjoy classical chamber music,
        which has long been a source of reflection and an outlet for creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always valued chamber music above solo performance—playing with others brings a sense of dialogue, devotion, and shared happiness that no individual practice can replace.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was never professionally trained, only received a brief 6-year formal instruction in my childhood.
        The boredom of the lessons has unfortunately delayed my rediscovery of the piano until high school.

        During my undergraduate studies, I formed <i>Paper Trio</i> with close friends—
        violinist <a href="https://soa.cufe.edu.cn/info/1169/7701.htm" class="author-focus">Yue Zhang</a> and
        cellist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binyue-lu-6bb403382/" class="author-focus">Binyue Lu</a>.
        Together, we explored works by Schubert, Brahms, Beethoven. This has been my best memory in college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those years of collective rehearsal and sight-reading were formative,
        not only in developing my musical sensitivity but also in shaping how I value collaboration.
        Currently, I am collaborating with local soprano <i>Liudmila Arno</i>, actively performing in Lausanne, Switzerland.
