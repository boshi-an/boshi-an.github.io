  <p>
    In 1847, in wintertime Paris, Augusta Holmès was born into a wealthy Irish family.
    In those days, members of the elite liked to hire private tutors for their children, and Augusta's parents were no exception; as a result, she received systematic training in piano, harmony, and counterpoint from a very young age.
    Even then, she displayed astonishing talent as a pianist and composer. Yet her greatest interest lay in composition—an area in which it was extremely difficult for women of that era to gain recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the mid-nineteenth-century European art world, which was almost entirely dominated by men, the notion that “women should not compose large-scale works” was widely accepted in compositional circles<a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>,
    and the professional path for women composers was therefore obstructed at every turn.
    The Paris Conservatory (Conservatoire de Paris)
    did not allow women to study composition or orchestration,
    offering women only courses such as vocal and instrumental performance;
    and the Prix de Rome, as the most important route for French composers to establish their standing, also kept women completely excluded for a long time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Holmès was not deterred by these rules—though she did not confront them head-on either: she carved out a path outside the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the margins of the Parisian musical world at the time, César Franck
    was playing the organ at the Sainte-Clotilde Basilica (Basilique Ste-Clotilde)
    because he was not favored by the Conservatory. Franck himself was indifferent to social hierarchies; a devout Christian,
    he cared only for his music. And Holmès, thanks to her compositional ability, her reputation among the cultural elite,
    and her serious artistic ambitions, soon attracted Franck's attention, and around 1870 began formally studying composition with him.
    Around the same period, Camille Saint-Saëns also greatly admired this distinctive composer,
    and in the journal Harmonie et Mélodie described her as “like a child:
    women know nothing of obstacles; their willpower can break through anything. Mademoiselle Holmès is a woman,
    an extremist”—and rumor has it that Saint-Saëns even proposed to her, only to be refused<a href="#fn5" id="ref5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like other women composers of her time such as Fanny Mendelssohn
    and Mélanie Hélène “Mel” Bonis,
    early in her career Holmès had to publish her works under a male pseudonym (Hermann Zenta)
    so that her music would not be dismissed simply because of the name on it.
    Of course, as she gradually gained recognition from figures such as Franck and Saint-Saëns—marking the point at which the French musical world began to regard her as a genuine “composer”—she stopped using that pseudonym.
    At the same time, many well-known women composers did not adopt male pseudonyms—for example, the familiar Cécile Chaminade.
    Chaminade excelled at chamber music and salon pieces, achieving great commercial success within areas that had already been “opened” to women at the time,
    without forcing the musical establishment to re-examine its ingrained assumptions about the relationship between the scale of a work and gender.
    Unlike Chaminade, Holmès remained determined to write large-scale works—something that inevitably meant facing far harsher challenges,
    the most central of which was precisely: how to make the music truly be “heard.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The creation of large-scale works has never been a domain that requires only inspiration; on the contrary, decisive factors are often the trust of the orchestra,
    the conductor, and the audience. For a large-scale work to come into being,
    one must persuade a conductor, an orchestra, a body of listeners,
    a handful of critics, and even an entire city.
    Thus, beyond bearing the prejudice that “women should not compose large-scale works,”
    Holmès also had to produce a work that was beyond reproach in both technique and structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    After studying with Franck, she had already developed a mature command of large forms.
    In 1880, she completed her first major purely orchestral work, <em>The Argonautes</em> (Les Argonautes).
    This is a symphonic poem based on Greek mythology, in which music alone carries the narrative function.
    After its premiere in 1880, the critical response was swift.
    The journal Le Ménestrel recorded a judging vote that compared Les Argonautes
    with Alphonse Duvernoy's <em>The Storm</em> (La tempête)<a href="#fn3" id="ref3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.
    The Paris municipal government had originally planned to use the vote to decide which work would be included in the public concert program and receive financial support.
    The panel of musical judges believed the two works should be ranked jointly in artistic value, but the municipal council ultimately refused to adopt this opinion
    and excluded Holmès's work.
  </p>

  <p>
    This experience made Holmès realize that direct confrontation was not feasible, and so she continued along her path outside the system.
    In 1878 she completed the large-scale choral-and-orchestral work <em>Hymn to Peace</em> (Hymne à la paix),
    and in 1889 she completed the <em>Ode to Triumph</em> (Ode triomphale), written for the Paris Exposition.
    Combining large chorus and orchestra, these works responded to the widespread public sentiments in postwar France,
    and carried her music into a broader public context.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1895, the opera <em>Black Mountain</em> was staged at the Paris Opéra,
    a symbolically significant moment in nineteenth-century French musical history: the opera of a woman composer
    appeared on that highest stage for the first time in complete form, effectively bringing a long-standing institutional absence to an end.
  </p>

  <p>
    The staging of La Montagne noire did not produce a lasting resonance. It neither entered the Paris Opéra's standard repertoire,
    nor did it lay down a repeatable path for later women composers<a href="#fn4" id="ref4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>: Holmès achieved an unprecedented appearance on that stage,
    but only as an isolated exception. The system was not shaken; it merely made room, courteously, for a single occasion.
    This work became Holmès's last time speaking to the public stage through a large-scale genre;
    afterward, she composed only a few scattered smaller works.
    In 1900, the art-song collection Les Heures was published; after completing that long and forceful public dialogue,
    she chose to let music return to the realm of private time.
    Three years later, she reached the end of that path outside the system. Her funeral was held at the Saint-Augustin Church (Église Saint-Augustin),
    with Saint-Saëns serving as organist<a href="#fn5" id="ref5b" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>.
    After that, her works were rarely performed in Paris's concert halls, and the musical establishment returned once more to its male-dominated course.
  </p>

  <p>
    What she did not live to see was, in that same year, the Prix de Rome finally began to admit women competitors;
    and ten years later, Lili Boulanger won the top prize<a href="#fn6" id="ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>.
